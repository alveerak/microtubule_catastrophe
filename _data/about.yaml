Abstract: >
  Microtubule catastrophe dynamics is not very well understood, especially in terms of the rates at which catastrophe occurs. To this end, we modeled microtubule catastrophe dynamics based on a gamma distribution model, which Gardner, Zanic et al. propose, versus multiple Poisson processes, an alternative distribution model, to determine which fits better. To do so, we used the data generated by Gardner and Zanic et al. in their paper “Depolymerizing Kinesins Kip3 and MCAK Shape Cellular Microtubule Architecture by Differential Control of Catastrophe” from monitoring fluorescently labeled and unlabeled microtubulin. In order to determine which model better fits the data, we (1) verified that fluorescently labeled microtubulin undergoes catastrophe at the same rate as unlabeled microtubulin, (2) simulated the two-step Poisson processes model, (3) calculated maximum likelihood estimations with confidence intervals for the parameters in each model, and (4) compared the two models using Akaike information criterion. We found that the gamma distribution model fits the microtubule catastrophe data better than the two-step Poisson processes model.

Summary:  >
  Using the raw data from Gardner, Zanic et al., we generate ECDFs of the fluorescently labeled microtubulin catastrophe events compared to the unlabled microtubulin catastrophe events and performed confidence intervals on mean-time to catastrophe in order to determine whether or not fluorescent labels impacts catastrophe events. Afterwards, we simulate the two-step Poisson processes using random number generation under various 𝛽2/𝛽1 values. We then were able to calculate maximum likelihood estimations for alpha and beta under the gamma distribution model and 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 values under the two-step Poisson processes model with confidence intervals. Using the Akaike information criterion, we determined that the gamma distribution model better fits microtubule catastrophe.
