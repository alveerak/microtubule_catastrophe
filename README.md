# Research Website for Microtubule Catastrophe Analysis
Cloning this repository will allow you to locally load up a website with resources and analysis regarding 
Microtubule Catastrophe.

It was made by modifying a bare-bones template website that allowed for publishing of our work as
an interactive website. It's tailored for easy inclusion of data files, plots,
and interactive figures. 

This repository is designed to be hosted as a website on GitHub using the
[GitHub Pages]() hosting service. This service is based on the Ruby framework
[Jekyll]() which is tailored for blog management. I've made several
modifications to the structure to be amenable for scientific publications. 

## Software requirements 
To deploy locally, you must have a [Ruby development environment]() installed as
well as [Jekyll](). You can install Jekyll via 

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Once you have Jekyll installed, you can install of the Ruby requirements for
this website by running the following in the command line from the template directory:

```
bundle install
```

The build and preview the website locally, execute the following:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

This will build the website and serve it up at the address:
[http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).
